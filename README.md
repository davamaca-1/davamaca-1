Hi - I'm davamaca-1 aka davemac aka Dave

  I'm an old, retired digital systems designer trying to learn a few new tricks.
  I fell in love with Unix, which led to falling in love with Linux, and I enjoy
  seeing what I can do with Slackware, which is the most Unix-y distro I know
  as well as being one of the oldest (like me)

  I hope you find some useful code and ideas in this work. It's an interesting
  experiment in using shell programming (mainly posix-compliant) as a larger scale programming
  language. It's not without its warts and blemishes, but who is?

  You can reach me at: davamaca@gmail.com - sometimes it takes awhile for me to respond
